# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a C++ developer with a passion for Unreal Engine, Godot and backend development using Golang and Java. I'm currently exploring the exciting world of drones and studying Vulkan and computer graphics.

## My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've been working on recently:

### Unreal Engine, VR and Lidar Point Cloud Processing

I've been developing a huge lidar point cloud processing tools with Unreal Engine 5, which is one of my favorite game engines.

I also have been working on VR game with multiplayer using Unreal Engine 5. Now I'm going to develop an interactive drone's camera simulator using Unreal Engine and Cesium.

### Backend Development

I've been working on a backend system using Golang that handles video and telemetry data stream from UAV. 

### Drone Development

I'm currently exploring the world of drones and working on a project that involves developing a drone that can capture high-resolution images. Here's a glimpse of the drone in action:

### Vulkan and Computer Graphics

I'm also currently studying Vulkan and computer graphics, and I've been working on a project that involves creating a real-time 3D rendering engine. Recently, I drawn my first 3D model in a scene with raw C++ :)
